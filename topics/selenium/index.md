Selenium is a software framework that allows you to do "remote control" of a web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) from a program written
in Java, Python, etc.

To use selenium, you need two things:

1.  A program written using the Selenium API (it may be written in Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, or any language that has a Selenium API)
1.  A *selenium-driver* which is a piece of software that sits between your program and the web browser.
