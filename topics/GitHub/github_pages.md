GitHub has an option to publish a website from any repo that contains either:
* just Plain HTML/CSS/JS
* code for a jekyll site (a static site creator based on Markdown and Ruby)

This content can either be at the top level of the repo, or in a subdirectory with the special name `/docs`

For projects in this class that use React Storybook, we use this to publish the React Storybook separately in repos with suffixes `-docs` and `-docs-qa`.

This screen animation shows how to enable GitHub pages on the `main` branch and for the `-docs` subdirectory:
