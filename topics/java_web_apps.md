Java was the language of choice for some of the earliest enterprise level web applications.  The Java Servlet API, combined with Java Server Pages,
was the basis of many large-scale web applications that are still in use today.

Writing web applications using Java Servlets can be a tedious undertaking with a steep learning curve.
The *very first* book in the O'Reilly *Head First* series was a book on this topic, with the unwieldy full title:

> Head First Servlets and JSP: Passing the Sun Certified Web Component Developer Exam

That book is now in its [2nd edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516680.do)

Various frameworks arose to try to simplify the process, including the popular [Spring](https://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) framework
for *dependency injection*.

A somewhat simpler framework is the [Spark framework for Java](/topics/spark-java.md) (sometimes called SparkJava to differentiate it from the [popular cluster computing platform called Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/index.html), with which it has nothing in common except the name)
