* [MongoDB Javadoc](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/)

MongoDB is a particular implementation of a technology known as NoSQL databases.

The basic idea is that you can store JSON objects in the cloud.   
Everything else is just sort of a riff on that theme.

To get started with MongoDB, I recommend this sequence of articles:

* [mongodb_new_database](/topics/mongodb/mongodb_new_database) Setting up an account and a new database
* [mongodb_spring_boot_basic_collection](/topics/mongodb/mongodb_spring_boot_basic_collection/) Setting up a simple collection in a Spring Boot application, i.e. one that has a flat structure of attributes (just one top level object per document, rather than one with nested objects).
* [mongodb_spring_boot_nested_collection](/topics/mongodb/mongodb_spring_boot_nested_collection/) Setting up a collection in Spring Boot that has nested objects and/or arrays/lists.
