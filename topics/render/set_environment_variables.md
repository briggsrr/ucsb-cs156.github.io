Previous versions of instructions for CS156 projects (from before F22) will have instructions for setting up environment variables on Heroku.com

Here is how you do it on Render.com.  Note that in this example, we set up temporary values for the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; these values will not be valid for logging into web apps that use OAuth, but they should at least allow the
app to get up and running.   The values can then later to be adjusted to correct values.
