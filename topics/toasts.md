A *toast* is a notification message that pops up in a web application (or other user interface) like a "piece of toast" and then disappears.

This is a front-end concern, and so one that is typically used in React code.

Code bases from the 20-21 academic year used a library called [`react-toast-notifications`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toast-notifications), but support for that library was discontinued.

Starting in W22, we are using <https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction>.
