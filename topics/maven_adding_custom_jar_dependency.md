One of the main advantages of Maven is not having to deal with jar files directly.  

If you depend on JUnit, you just add it as a dependency in your `pom.xml`,  you just add the magic words to specify
`JUnit` as a dependency in your `pom.xml`, and the jar gets automatically downloaded and added to your classpath.

Same with all the parts of Spring Framework, Apache Commons, or whatever.   Pretty much anything that is a standard 3rd party java library.

But what is the thing you need is NOT standard?  Maybe its too new to have been put into Maven Central?

Examples:

* The Virginia Tech Corgis library
* One CS56 legacy code project using code from another
