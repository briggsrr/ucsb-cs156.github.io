# What is a toolchain?

According to Wikipedia: "In software, a toolchain is a set of programming tools that 
is used to perform a complex software development task or to create a software product, 
which is typically another computer program or a set of related programs."

The Toolchain we'll use in CS56 includes:
* Java 11 (the `javac` and `java` commands, plus others that come with the OpenJDK 11 Java Deveopment Kit)
* Maven (the `mvn` command)
* Git (the `git` command)
* An editor or IDE (`vim`, `emacs`, `VS Code`, `IntelliJ`, etc.)

Also may be useful:
* Spring CLI (Downloaded from <https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli>
