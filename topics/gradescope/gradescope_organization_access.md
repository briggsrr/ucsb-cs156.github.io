This page is mostly for instructors and staff that are trying to debug why students are not not able to find their repos 
in the drop down menu on Gradescope for submission directly from GitHub.

This page may be of some help: 
* <https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps>

I think what needs to happen is that someone that has used OAuth to authorize Gradescope needs to go under Settings,
then Applications, then OAuth, then find Gradescope, and then either authorize or "request authorization" for ucsb-cs56-w20
