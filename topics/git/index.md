The software package known as *git* is an open source version control system.  

A *git repository* is a collection of files (a directory tree) for a software project, along with the entire version history of those files over time.

The commerical company *github* provides web-based software and cloud-based hosting for git repositories.
* [github.com](https://github.com) is the main site for github services

# Windows

If you find that when you type `git status` you see every single file is modified, it might be because of line endings.

Type `git config --global core.autocrlf true` to fix it
