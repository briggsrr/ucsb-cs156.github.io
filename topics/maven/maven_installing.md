# CSIL

On CSIL, Maven should be installed already.  The command is `mvn`.

# Windows

Try these links for advice:

# Mac

The easiest way is probably to first install Homebrew, then use:

```
brew install maven
```

# Linux

Your mileage may vary, but on Ubuntu, this seems to work (this is what we do for the Gradescope backend, which is Ubuntu based):

```
apt-get -y install maven
```
