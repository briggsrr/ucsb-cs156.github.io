# Javadoc: FAQ

## There's no javadoc for one of my classes!

Check to make sure that your class starts with:

```
public class Foo
```

and not just

```
class Foo
```

If you have a class that doesn't explicily say `public` in front of it, javadoc will not be generated.  
Classes that don't say either `public` or `private` are treated as *package private* which means they are only
accessible within the package where they appear.

If you are writing code without packages at all, then *all* of your code is in the so-called 
"unnamed package", which means that your "package private" classes "seem" to be public.  But, they really aren't.
