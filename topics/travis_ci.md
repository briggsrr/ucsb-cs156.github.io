# What is Travis-CI

Travis-CI is a cloud based system for continous integration (that's what the CI stands for)

Continous Integration (CI) is a whole topic unto itself; we'll discuss that further in a separate article: [Continous Integration]{/topics/continuous_integration), but the short
version is that CI refers to the practice of automatically testing how any new change integrates with your entire code base every time
you make a change.

In practice, "making a change" means "checking changes in to your version control system (e.g. GitHub)".   Running tests, in the context
of Java, means running JUnit tests.

This article assumes you already know how to work with Java programming and JUnit, and focuses on getting your code to work 
with Travis-CI.
