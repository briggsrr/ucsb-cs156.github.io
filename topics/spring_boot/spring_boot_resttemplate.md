Suppose you are in the backend code of your Spring Boot application and you want to access some other API, e.g. the <https://developer.ucsb.edu> API.

What code can you use?

Here is a tutorial on the REST client built into Spring Boot called `RestTemplate`:

* <https://www.baeldung.com/rest-template>
* <https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html>

This one covers the Maven dependencies that need to be in the `pom.xml`

# Setting Headers 

Many APIs (including, for example, <https://developer.ucsb.edu>) require setting headers.

For example, <https://developer.ucsb.edu> requires you to set: 

```
accept: application/json
ucsb-api-version: 1.0
ucsb-api-key: value-specific-to-each-api-user
```

How do you set these headers?  This article explains:
