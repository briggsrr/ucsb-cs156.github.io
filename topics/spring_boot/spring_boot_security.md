There are many aspects of Security.   Here are two:

* Authentication: Making sure the user is who they say they are.
* Authorization: Making sure the user can only do what they are allowed to do.

There are other aspects too, such as preventing cross-site scripting attacks, denial of service attacks, to name a couple.

As we explore those in the context of Spring Boot, we'll add resources to this page.

# Authentication

* In this course, we generally handle this with OAuth
* That way we don't have to deal with storing usernames/passwords.
* See: [Spring Boot: OAuth](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/spring_boot_oauth/)

# Authorization

This is still more of a work in progress in terms of understanding how to do this with Spring Boot.  Here are a few resources.
