We have found the following extensions useful for working with Spring Boot:

* The Spring Boot Extension Pack from Pivotal
   * This includes several others, including Spring Boot Initializr, Spring Boot Dashboard, and Spring Boot Support
 
* The Spring Boot Tools from Pivotal
   * This provides additional auto-complete support for `application.properties`
