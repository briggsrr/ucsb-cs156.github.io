## The short version

The `"\n"` character represents a newline on some systems, but other systems have different newline conventions.

For more portable Java code, instead of hard coding `"\n"` in your strings, use either:

```Java
  String nl = System.getProperty("line.separator");
```

or, use the `%n` format specifier to get a system-independent newline.

Note that some sources suggest that on System.out and System.err it really doesn't matter; that the lower layers of Java plumbing will take care of the problem.
