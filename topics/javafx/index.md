# {{page.title}}

JavaFX was introduced in 2008 as a replacement for Swing, which up to that time, had been the primary development platform for GUI development in Java.

* Wikipedia Article: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX>

There is some controversy as to whether JavaFX is a "dead" technology.   The basis of calling is "dead" seems to be more 
around the notion that development of GUI apps on "desktop/laptop" type platforms is a dead-end&mdash;with the alternatives 
being webapps (based on HTML5) and mobile apps, i.e. Android).

But, if one accepts that notion of developing GUIs on a desktop as a reasonable thing to do, then JavaFX seems preferable to
Swing.
