# {{page.title}}

# `heroku login` tries to open browser, but you are on CSIL

Try: `heroku login -i`

# When using `mvn heroku:deploy`: `Could not find app name: No 'heroku' remote found.` 

Symptom: You use `mvn heroku:deploy` and see:

```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal com.heroku.sdk:heroku-maven-plugin:2.0.3:deploy 
(default-cli) on project spring-boot-github-oauth-demo01: 
Failed to deploy application: Could not find app name: No 'heroku' remote found. -> [Help 1]
```

Possible Causes, and Solutions:

* Make sure you are logged into the heroku cli
   * Solution: `heroku login`
* Make sure that the correct heroku app is defined in your `pom.xml`
   * Solution: list your apps with `heroku apps` then check the value of `<appName>` in the `heroku-maven-plugin`
* No remote is defined for heroku
   * To check, type `git remote -v` and see if a remote for `heroku` is listed.  If not:
   * To add it, use `heroku git:remote --app app-name` (replace `app-name` with the name of your app)
