If you are trying to do a `@PostMapping` in your Spring Boot application and you are getting
the error

```
403 - Forbidden
```

The problem is likely that you didn't include this magic line in your form:

```
              <input type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}" th:value="${_csrf.token}" />
```

The solution is to include that magic line in your form.

The reason has to do with preventing cross site request forgery.

# The explanation

Suppose I was running a virtual online bank, and it had the following endpoint:

`badbank.com/transfer?from=you&to=me&amount=1000000`

The `transfer` endpoint allows for the transfer of an amount of money from one account to another: in the above case, you'd be giving me $1,000,000.

Obviously, you'd rather not navigate to that link on accident or else you'd find yourself in financial ruin.

### So I'll just not navigate to it then

You'd think so, but consider the scenario where you encounter the following link on your favorite website:

<a href="badbank.com/transfer?from=you&to=me&amount=1000000"> Click here to get $100!</a>

If you hover the above link, you'll notice that it actually navigates you to the malicious endpoint previously discussed. This method of attack is known in security as **Cross Site Scripting** (XSS).

### This seems bad. How do we deal with it?

With CSRF tokens! Imagine now that along with `amount`, `from`, and `to` variables, the `/transfer` endpoint also required a `token` value that would be generated randomly and unpredictably on the bank's server when the client navigates to the bank's website. 

That way every request could be validated as coming from a form that their server gave to a client, and not some shady link on another website. Now the attacker can't embed a malicious link in their website anymore, as they won't be able to predict/fake the tokens being generated by the server.
