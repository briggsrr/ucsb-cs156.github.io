# {{page.title}}

The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a visual language—meaning that it includes standards for drawing diagrams—that is used for documenting the architecture of systems.

I've asked students that have graduated: how often does UML come up in practice?  The answers typically are things like:

* Not that often
* Occasially, though we end up drawing some diagrams, and then it's sort of
  useful if folks know the basics

You may see some UML like diagrams in the Head First Java book.  We likely won't emphasize it in this course, but it is a good thing to know about.
