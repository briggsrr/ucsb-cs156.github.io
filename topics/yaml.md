# {{page.title}}

Yaml is a syntax for specifying structured data.  In this way, it is an alternative to:

* JSON
* XML

It's main advantage is that it is far more compact that either JSON or XML. That makes it easier to read for humans; less extraneous syntax in the way.

It's main drawback is that, like Python, it relies on whitespace and indentation to indicate hierarchy, which can be tedious to get right and/or debug.
