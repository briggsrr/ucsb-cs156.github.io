Gradle is an alternative build system to Maven, but one that we typically
don't use in CMPSC 156.  It is documented here just for completeness.

While any Java project can use either Gradle or Maven, typically:

* Spring Boot project use Maven
* Android projects use Gradle

This isn't necessarily because each is more "suited to purpose" for these applications; it seems to be more of a historical thing.
