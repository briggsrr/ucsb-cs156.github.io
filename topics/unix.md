Linux is the operating system that is used on the machines in Phelps 3525 and the CSIL lab.

Linux is a particular variant of the Unix family of operating systems.

The Mac operating system from version 10 onward (i.e. MacOS X) is also a Unix derived system.

Most of what we'll be using related to Unix/Linux in this course actually pertains to command line tools that you access from the bash shell.    This includes commands such as `ls`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.

While these commands are associated with Unix, because they originally appeared on Unix systems, in fact, they have been ported to many other systems as well.  Cygwin is a package for Windows that allows users to run many programs associated with Unix on Windows systems.

You can also get many of these tools by using a bash shell for Windows such as the *git bash shell* that comes with *Git for Windows*, or the bash shell that is being provided with Windows 10.
