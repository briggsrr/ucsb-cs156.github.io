## The big picture

In this chapter, there's an introduction to the idea of test-driven development.

We also see the Java "for each" style loop, e.g.

```
for (int cell: locationCells) {
  // do something with cell
}
```


There are also introductions to 
* using `Math.random()`
* using type casts on primitive types
