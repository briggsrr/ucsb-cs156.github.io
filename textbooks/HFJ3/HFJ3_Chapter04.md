## The big picture

This chapter reviews and reinforces some basic concepts of Object
Oriented programming—concepts that should already be familiar to you
from CS24 and CS32 (in C++).

So, while the *concepts* in this chapter should be review for you,
they are important enough that it is worth going over them again,
especially because:

-   We can now see them in the context of Java (emphasizing that they are universal to 
    OOP, and not specific to C++).
-   We can remind you of these things in case you have been away from OOP for a while 
    (perhaps taking CS40 and CS64?).
-   We can give you a second shot at this stuff in case it didn't quite sink in the 
    first time (because you were drowning in a sea of C++ syntax details, 
    segmentation faults, etc.).

The concepts we want to review here are the ideas of:

-   Instance variables (and their connection with state)
-   Methods (and their connection with behavior)

In Computer Science, we often talk about things being "stateful" or
"stateless"—and this can be sort of an abstract concept. This chapter
is designed to make it more concrete, so that, as the authors of the
Head First books are fond of saying it "sticks in your head".
